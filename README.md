# The Ontological Protocol (TOP)

> **Esse est Operari.** (To be is to execute.)

## Overview
The Ontological Protocol is a proposal for a **Third-Order Cybernetic Economy**. It moves beyond the *Store of Value* paradigm to a *Flow of Value* paradigm, designed for an era where the marginal cost of reproduction approaches zero (Generative AI).

Instead of relying on central planning or fixed algorithmic constants, the protocol is **Radically Endogenous**. It measures the thermodynamic state of the network to define its own physics.

## Core Mechanics (v3.0)

### 1. Thermodynamic Price ($B_{prod}$)
The protocol does not use oracles. It discovers the **Minimum Viable Burn** by observing the bottom 5% of successful transactions. This creates a hard physical floor for value.

### 2. Entropic Attribution ($\alpha$)
Who owns the value of an AI-generated output? The model? The data? The prompter?
TOP calculates attribution based on **Information Entropy**. Inputs with higher structure (lower entropy) mathematically claim a larger share of the output's Ripple Score.

### 3. The Cybernetic Lung ($\epsilon$)
The system breathes. Instead of a fixed inflation target, it monitors the **Shannon Entropy ($H$)** of the wealth distribution.
- Too much order (Monopolies)? -> The system expands (Summer).
- Too much chaos (Noise)? -> The system contracts (Winter).

## The Simulation ("Genesis Diagnosis")
Included in this repository is a Python simulation (`genesis_diagnosis.py`) that maps typical actors from the Fiat Economy into the Ontological Protocol.

**Results:**
- **Rent-Seekers (High Volume, High Entropy):** Devalued by ~60%.
- **Producers (Low Volume, Low Entropy):** Revalued by ~3000%.
- **Builders (Symbiotic):** Become the dominant nodes.
