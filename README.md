The transition from an industrial economy to an intelligence economy requires a fundamental
revision of value theory. Traditional monetary systems, based on static asset ownership and scarcity,
fail to efficiently allocate resources in an environment of zero-marginal-cost reproduction (AI).
This paper proposes a thermodynamic economic protocol based on the axiom Esse est Operari
(To be is to execute). Instead of bilateral exchange, the system utilizes a Decoupled Ledger
where resource consumption (Burn) and value creation (Mint) are separated events. Value is
determined algorithmically via a recursive Proof-of-Impact mechanism (The Ripple Algorithm) on
a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG). This architecture enables a trustless, non-hierarchical coordination
of resources, effectively solving the alignment problem for autonomous agents (and also humans)
through thermodynamic incentives.
